# To-Do
- [ ] Change it so that text box appears when entering/editing scores, not alert
- [ ] Change it so that you can add scores to any hole
  - Or at least be notified that you can't add a score to that section yet until previous one is completed
- [ ] Update UI to make it more appealing
  - Maybe add a score reference guide ?
## Potential Future Features
- Changing golf course prompts you to reset players/scores if you already have some
- Add an option to add your own golf course with customizable data
